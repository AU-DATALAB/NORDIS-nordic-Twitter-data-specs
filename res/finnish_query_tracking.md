# Tracking how the Finnish scrape is developing
All the months for which there is scraping, a check needs to be conducted to make sure ALL tweets per month have been gathered.

Important notes:
1. The scraper scrapes from the last date of the month towards the 1st
2. If you do a re-scrape into the same file, it starts from scratch - only ever rescrape to new files! And specify the new dates to duplicate as little as possible!
